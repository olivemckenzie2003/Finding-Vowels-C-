Filter in multiples of 3

Your job is to in the exercise.cpp file and write a range based for loop that only filters in multiples of 3 from a collection and print them out using std::cout. For example if we have a collection containing the data below : 

    std::vector<int> numbers {1,21,4,5,7,3,9,3,5,17,15};

and filter multiples of 3, we would print

21 3 9 3 15

PAY ATTENTION ! : Your code should put a trailing space (" ") after the last multiple of 3 that you print out. If you leave that out, our testing code will register that as a problem!

Your code should go between the comments

        //Don't modify anything above this line
        //Your code should go below this line
     
        //Your code should go above this line
        //Don't modify anything below this line

in the exercise.cpp file.
