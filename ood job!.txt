ood job!
Yes! You got this right! The program will run indefinitely. The reason is that when the loop hits 0 and we --i in hope to get a -1 and stop the loop, the value in our unsigned char will underflow and be the max value we can store in a char, namely 255. It will be >=0 and the loop will have no reason to stop! It will keep running indefinitely printing values between 0 and 255.
Question 1:

We know that it is possible to treat char types as integers, provided the range of values in a char type satisfy our needs. Now, without compiling and running this program, what will this program do when run ? 

      #include <iostream>  
        int main(){
     
            for( unsigned char i{10}; i >= 0 ; --i){
                std::cout << "value : " << static_cast<unsigned int>(i) << std::endl;
            }
         
            return 0;
        }
